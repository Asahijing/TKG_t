# TKG
This is an implementation of Topic-level Knowledge Sub-Graphs for Multi-turn Dialogue Generation (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2021.107499). 
TKG accounts for topic-coherence, fluency, and diversity of generated responses. Specifically, we first decompose the given KG into a set of topic-level sub-graphs, with each sub-graph capturing a semantic component of the input KG. Furthermore, we design a Topic-level Sub-graphs Attention Network to calculate the comprehensive representation of both sub-graphs and previous turns of dialogue utterances, which then decoded with the current turn into a response. By using sub-graphs, our model is able to attend to different topical components of the KG and enhance the topic-coherence. We perform extensive experiments on two datasets of DuRecDial and KdConv to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing strong baselines.
